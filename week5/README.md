# Week 5 - Titanic Logistic Regression Evaluation

**Goal:** Evaluate and improve the Logistic Regression model using feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

## Steps:
1. Load the cleaned dataset (`titanic_processed.csv`).
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Apply **StandardScaler** for feature normalization.
4. Train a Logistic Regression model and evaluate it with:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## Key Learnings:
- Importance of scaling features before model training.
- How to use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
- Model evaluation techniques using confusion matrix and classification report.
