# Week 7 - SVM on Titanic Dataset

**Goal:** Train and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the processed Titanic dataset.  
Compare the SVM performance with previous models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

## Steps
1. Load `titanic_processed.csv`.
2. Split features and target.
3. Train SVM (`SVC`) with RBF kernel.
4. Evaluate accuracy and classification report.
5. Compare SVM results with previous models.
6. Save predictions for reporting.

## Outputs
- `week7_svm.ipynb` (Colab notebook)
- `week7_svm_predictions.csv` (predictions)
